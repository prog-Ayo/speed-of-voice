This website analyzes your speech speed—whether you speak fast, slow, or at a moderate pace. You can click on the microphone icon on the website to record your voice, after which the program will analyze the audio and display the result. Alternatively, if you have an MP3 audio file, you can upload it to the website, and it will analyze the speech and provide feedback.

1- Open the terminal and run the command npm install to install the required packages.

3- Open any web browser and go to http://localhost:3000/.

4- The website is now ready to use.
